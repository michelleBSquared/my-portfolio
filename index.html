          <h3>Front-end Development</h3>
          <p>
            I have experience with JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I also have
            experience writing and consuming REST APIs. I have worked for an
            enterprise level Backup and Disaster Recovery company following
            Agile methodologies where we used Git along with Bitbucket and JIRA.
          </p>
          <p>
            Frameworks and tools I've used include Angular, Vue, Bootstrap,
            among others.

          <p>
            As a small business owner, I designed, developed and deployed
            <a href="https://www.bsquareddevelopment.com/">this website</a>. So
            I know my way around WordPress!

            And it was a learning process for sure. I've tried to make it as
            fast as possible, while making it secure and accessible. It's hosted
            by InMotion hosting and developed using the Highend Theme with
            custom CSS.

            requirements.

            As a member of the UI/UX team, I've debugged and modified software
            and developed code fixes and enhancements. All while communicating
            effectively with QA, management, and other teams to stay on track
            and meet deadlines.

          First and foremost, my family is my priority. They are the reason I do
          pretty much anything. I went back to school later in life, when I had
          a husband and two small kids who needed me. It was a lot of work, and
          at times felt impossible. But I hope in the end, that I can be a
          source of inspiration for them. An example that with hard work, you
          can do anything you put your mind to.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am an avid learner. I have a library of books at home. I constantly
          read, listen to podcasts, and watch videos. Not only do I want to stay
          up-to-date with emerging technolgy, but I want to be the best version
          of me that I can possibly be.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was a criminal justice major in undgergrad and a paralegal for
          almost 10 years before I got into technology. I loved the law and I
          loved serving people, but the job as a whole left me feeling
          unfufilled, and frankly, unchallenged. After a while, being a
          paralegal just felt redundant, like doing homework all the time. Being
          in technolgoy has filled that gap for me. I can use technology to
          better people's lives, and I am challenged every single day, even when
          it feels like technology hates me. LOL
        </p>
        <p>
          I spend my free time reading, sewing, hiking, and playing Minecraft or
          Plants vs. Zombies Battle for the Neighborville with my boys.
